# Project description

We assume a private club that distributes an entry password to members once a month. They use this password to access the club. Members obtain the password by connecting to a secret URL link. The link is communicated to them during their last physical meeting. Currently it is just an http connection, which allows anyone observing the traffic to read the club password. The objective of the project is to replace the http connection with an https connection.
